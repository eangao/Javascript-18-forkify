    //     So it will be loaded from the API, right?
    // We are not loading this recipe from the bookmarks.
    // And actually we won't do that.
    // But what we will do is to now use the data that we store
    // in the bookmarks array and the state
    // to basically Mark any recipe that we load as bookmarked,
    // if it is already in the bookmarks array.
    // So that probably sounded more complicated
    // than it actually is.
    // Okay so let's go here back to the model
    // and then to our function, which loads the recipe.
    // So that is this one.
    // So here the as we got all this data
    // and store it in the state.
    // Then what we can do is to check if there is already a recipe
    // with the same ID in the bookmarks state.
    // And if it is then we will mark the current recipe
    // that we just loaded from the API as bookmarked set to true.
    // So let's use
    // one of the nice array methods that we learned about,
    // which is the sum method.
    // And remember that the sum method returns true or false.
    // And so that's great for doing an if check like this.
    // So here we can check if state.bookmarks.some
    // which basically means any,
    // so at least that's how I like to think about this method.
    // So this method will loop over an array
    // and then return true if any of them actually has to
    // for the condition that we specify here.
    // So if bookmark.id is the same
    // as the ID that we just received here
    // okay, let's call this here bookmark actually.
    // And so basically what this means is that
    // if there is any bookmark, which has the bookmark ID
    // equal to the ID that we just received
    // well, then we want the current recipe
    // which is state.recipe to be bookmarked.
    // So bookmark equal to true.
    // Okay and otherwise we wanted a set to false.
    // And so with this, all the recipes that we now load
    // we'll always have bookmarked set to either true or false.
